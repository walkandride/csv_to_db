Identify Key Performance Indicators (KPI's):
1. **Check-In Rate**: The percentage of active members who check in during a specific period. This helps gauge member engagement and gym usage.
2. **Peak Hours**: Identifying the busiest times of the day or week can help with staffing and resource allocation.
3. **Average Check-Ins Per Member**: The average number of times a member checks in during a month. This can indicate member engagement and satisfaction.
4. **New Member Check-In Rate**: The frequency at which new members check in during their first month. This can help assess the onboarding process.
5. **Inactive Member Rate**: The percentage of members who haven't checked in for a certain period (e.g., 30 days). This can help identify members at risk of canceling their memberships.
6. **Retention Rate**: The percentage of members who continue to check in regularly over time. This is crucial for understanding member loyalty.
7. **Churn Rate**: The percentage of members who stop checking in and eventually cancel their memberships. This helps identify potential issues with member satisfaction.
8. **Class Attendance Rate**: For gyms offering classes, tracking the attendance rate can help understand the popularity and effectiveness of different classes.
9. **Equipment Usage Rate**: Monitoring how often specific equipment is used can help with maintenance schedules and purchasing decisions.
10. **Member Feedback**: Collecting and analyzing feedback from members about their check-in experience can provide insights into areas for improvement.
